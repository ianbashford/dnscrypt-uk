dnscrypt.uk is a public DNSCrypt service hosted in the UK

## What is dnscrypt
from [dnscrypt.info](https://dnscrypt.info)

> DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and havenâ€™t been tampered with.
> It is an open specification, with free and open source reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with any company nor organization.
> Free, DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers are available all over the world.

As well as having secure DNS, what about building a child friendly DNS Server for the house that filters adult content - ideas [here](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/DNSCrypt-Proxy)

## How to connect

Clients exist for linux, windows, osx, ios and android.  All can be found here
[dnscrypt.info/implementations](https://dnscrypt.info/implementations)

A really simple solution is to use DNSCrypt-Proxy - [https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy]

## Hosting
dnscrypt.uk hosts two services - dnscrypt.uk (on a DigitalOcean droplet ) and v.dnscrypt.uk (on a vultr high frequency compute).
Both services also host function as anonymous relays.
