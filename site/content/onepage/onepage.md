> DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and havenâ€™t been tampered with.
> It is an open specification, with free and open source reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with any company nor organization.
> Free, DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers are available all over the world.
