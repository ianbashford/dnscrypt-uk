      <description>DNScrypt.uk is a public DNSCrypt service hosted in the UK
What is dnscrypt? from dnscrypt.info:
   DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver.     It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and havenâ€™t been tampered with. It is an open specification, with free and open source reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with any company nor organization.</description>
